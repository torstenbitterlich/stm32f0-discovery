STM32F0-Discovery Demo Application using FreeRTOSv8.0.0
=======================================================

# Description

This is a fork of [](https://github.com/rgrover/stm32f0-discovery). I just modified the project to be able to compile it on the console using a makefile.

# Usage

You will need the arm toolchain to build the project. I used this one: [](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded).
Beside that, you need to add the FreeRTOS Source to the project. The current version 8.0.0 works.

If you setup a path to the locally installed toolchain, you will be able to build the project using "make". This will generate the binary, which can be loaded
to the target hardware using openocd/gdb.

# Acknowledgements

The Makefile for the peripheral library for the STM32F0 was taken from [](https://github.com/szczys/stm32f0-discovery-basic-template).
